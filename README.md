I am an aspiring GRC Analyst with a profound interest in technology and a dedication to solving complex problems. 

My journey into cybersecurity from an unconventional background has led me to develop a passion for expanding my knowledge in different domains and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join an organization as a GRC Analyst.
